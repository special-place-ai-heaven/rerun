# Rerun desktop app

An Electron shell around the Rerun web app: the window loads your server (set at build time, or typed on first launch) and everything a person sees is drawn by `apps/ui`. A web deploy reaches the
app without a desktop release. The shell only adds what a browser tab cannot: a native window and
menus, sign-in through the system browser, links and downloads that behave like a desktop app,
updates of its own.

```
src/main/       the main process: window, navigation rules, permissions, IPC, deep links, updater
src/preload/    exposes window.rerunShell (to the server's pages) and window.rerunShellLocal (to the
                shell's own pages), nothing to any other origin
src/renderer/   the shell's own pages, served from rerun-shell://app: offline, find bar, server picker
src/shared/     IPC channel names, the language packs of the shell
e2e/            scenarios played by `pnpm verify:desktop`, and the update loop
```

The contract with the web app is `packages/contracts/src/desktop-shell.ts`: `window.rerunShell`, its
`apiVersion` and its `capabilities`. The web reads it in one place, `apps/ui/lib/desktop-shell`, and
checks a capability before using it: an app stays installed for months while the web ships every day.
The server recognizes the app by the `RerunDesktop/<version> (<platform>; <channel>)` token of its
User-Agent and renders the desktop chrome from the first paint (`<html data-desktop-shell>`).

## Run it

```bash
pnpm dev:desktop                 # the development app ("Rerun Dev") on this workspace's hub
RERUN_DESKTOP_URL=https://your-server.example pnpm dev:desktop
```

`RERUN_DESKTOP_URL` points a development or staging build at any server; a packaged stable build
ignores it. `RERUN_DESKTOP_USER_DATA` gives a run a data folder of its own.

## Channels

| Channel | App | Id | URL scheme | Server |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `stable` | Rerun | `build.rerun.desktop` | `rerun-desktop://` | `RERUN_DESKTOP_DEFAULT_URL` |
| `staging` | Rerun Staging | `build.rerun.desktop.staging` | `rerun-desktop-staging://` | `RERUN_DESKTOP_DEFAULT_URL` |
| `dev` | Rerun Dev | `build.rerun.desktop.dev` | `rerun-desktop-dev://` | the local hub |

Each has its own data folder, icon (`pnpm icons` draws them from the iOS icon) and update feed. A
build from the sources without `RERUN_DESKTOP_DEFAULT_URL` opens on "Connect to your server". The
name and the icon are build parameters: a fork ships under its own (see `TRADEMARK.md`).

## Security

The window shows remote content, so: sandboxed renderer, context isolation, no Node in any page, a
preload that exposes a fixed API and never `ipcRenderer`. Every IPC handler checks the sending frame
(main frame, the server's origin or the shell's pages). Only the server navigates in the window; the
rest of the web opens in the browser, Stripe's hosted pages in a window of the app's session.
Permissions are refused unless the server asks for one its features use (notifications, clipboard,
microphone, screen capture, full screen). Fuses: no `RunAsNode`, no `NODE_OPTIONS`, no inspector
flags, cookies encrypted with the system keychain, the app loaded from its integrity-checked asar.

## Sign-in

Google refuses embedded web views, so Google and Apple sign in through the system browser (RFC 8252,
PKCE): the app opens `/auth/desktop` with a challenge, the person confirms in the browser, the browser
hands a one-time code back through the app's URL scheme (or shows it to paste), and the app spends it
with its verifier at `/api/desktop/auth/exchange` for a session of its own. Email and phone codes work
in the window as they do on the web. A service's sign-in (Gmail, an MCP server) takes the iOS app's
chain: a ticket, the browser, a claim back through the scheme.

## Self-hosted

"Connect to your server" (the menu's Change Server…, or the link under the sign-in methods) asks
`/api/desktop/config` whether the address is a Rerun hub that serves this version, warns about plain
http on another machine, and moves the app there: each server keeps its own session. The IPC guard
follows the server the window shows, not only the configured one.

## Native

- Notifications: the web's notifications go through the system's (`notifications.show`) as soon as the
  person is in another app; a click brings the window back and the page opens what it was about.
  Whether someone is looking comes from the window's state (`lib/desktop-shell/attention.ts`), since
  the window keeps its timers when hidden and `document.visibilityState` stays visible.
- The count of what waits: on the Dock (macOS), a dot over the taskbar button (Windows), the tray.
- A tray icon (menu bar on macOS): open, what waits, open at login, updates, quit. On Windows and
  Linux, closing the window leaves the app there (a setting); macOS keeps the app in the Dock.
- Open at login, started hidden; settings in the Desktop tab of the account (`settings.get/set`).
- A browser that signed the app in (cookie `rr_desktop_app`) offers once per tab to open the page in
  the app (`rerun-desktop://open?path=/…`, a path of the server and nothing else): the link of an
  email lands in the browser, the work happens in the app.
- Quick ask: ⌘⇧Space (Ctrl+Shift+Space) from any app opens a small floating field for the Chief of
  Staff (`/quick-ask`). The text goes to the main window through the origin's localStorage, never a
  URL a link could forge, and the main window asks it in a new conversation.
- New Window (⌘⇧N): another window of the same session; each keeps its own workspace (the web
  holds it per tab).
- Menus and tray in the language the person reads Rerun in (`locale.set`), a right-click menu
  (editing, spelling, links, images).

## Release

```bash
RERUN_DESKTOP_CHANNEL=staging RERUN_DESKTOP_DEFAULT_URL=https://your-server.example pnpm --filter rerun-desktop package
```

It makes one installer per architecture (a DMG for Apple Silicon and one for Intel, an NSIS installer for
x64 and one for Arm): a universal build carries Chromium twice. The updater takes the file of its own
architecture from the feed.

Unsigned (ad hoc on macOS) unless signing credentials are in the environment: see
`electron-builder.config.ts`. Updates are off until `RERUN_DESKTOP_UPDATE_URL` names a feed you host (generic provider: the installers and their latest*.yml); there is no default feed. A bad release is
pulled by publishing a higher version; `DESKTOP_MIN_SHELL_VERSION` on the server makes older apps
update before they load anything.

## Tests

```bash
pnpm --filter rerun-desktop test                                         # the rules, without Electron
pnpm verify:desktop --scenario apps/desktop-app/e2e/shell.mjs            # the window's rules

```

CI builds the installers of every pull request that touches the app on macOS, Windows (NSIS) and
Linux (AppImage, deb), unsigned, and keeps them three days as artifacts of the run.

Playwright cannot click a system notification or a native menu, and under Playwright macOS does
not draw the traffic lights in a capture: those are checked by hand. Windows and Linux are built in
CI and need a real machine for the last look.
