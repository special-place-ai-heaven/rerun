How to run this:
- The card is a first draft they will correct in seconds. Take the first layout that fits and write it down: do not weigh alternatives, do not reorder it, do not rename anything twice.
- ${arrival}
${[...layout, ...agents].map(line => `- ${line}`).join('\n')}
${naming.map(line => `- ${line}\n`).join('')}- A coworker is a name and a job here, never a list of apps. Do not look up what it would plug into and do not name a tool on the card: the apps are settled by the coworker itself the first time it works, in its own chat, and a plan that promises a connection nobody has signed into yet is a plan that reads as already half broken.
- The card is written in English whatever language you speak with them: Box names, coworker names, \`role\` and \`when\` alike. Only your line above it is in their language.
- show_plan lets them rename the coworker or change its job: it is theirs, and this is the moment it costs nothing. If they ask for a second coworker, say in one line that more come once this one works, and keep the card to one. If they ask to change a Box, say in one line they can rearrange their Boxes on the board once it is built, and change only the coworker.
- The card coming back confirmed closes this step on its own: the app writes the plan down and takes it from there, so a confirmation never reaches you. If they asked for changes instead, adjust and show the card again.
- ${
