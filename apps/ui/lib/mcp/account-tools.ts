// Static MCP tool definitions advertised by the Rerun account server for `tools/list`.
// Pure data (no server deps) so the route can serve them without importing the service layer.
//
// Audience: an AI coding agent (Claude Code and friends) configuring a Rerun account from
// outside the app. The surface covers shaping an agent — prompt, skills, scheduled tasks,
// webhook triggers, connectors, private database — and checking what it did: send_message and
// the run tools exist so an agent can be tested without first inventing a routine for it.

// Same shape as the `setup` field of capture_template_agents, on purpose: an agent written from
// here and an agent captured into a template answer the same question in the same words.
