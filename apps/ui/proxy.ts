         * - og/ and render/ (OG images and the pages the screenshot service captures: a headless
         *   navigation sends `sec-fetch-dest: document`, which would provision an anonymous user
         *   and a workspace on every capture)
         * - api/t/ (public webhook triggers, for the same reason: a GET trigger opened in a browser
         *   or unfurled by Slack would provision a user and a workspace on every link preview)
         * - api/files (uploads: Next tees the request body to hand it to the middleware, and truncates
         *   it at 10MB doing so, which silently corrupted every upload past that. The tee also buffers
         *   the whole body in memory, so streaming a file through is only possible from outside the
         *   matcher. These routes authenticate themselves through requireWorkspaceId().)
         * - api/llm (the boxes' model proxy, for the same 10MB truncation: an image a box hands its
         *   model travels inline in base64, and a cut body reached the route as "Invalid JSON". The
         *   caller is an engine with its key, never a browser with a session to refresh.)
         * - api/v1 (the mobile API: callers send a bearer token, never a cookie, so there is no
         *   session to refresh, and each route authenticates itself through apiRoute())
         * - email/ (artwork fetched by mail clients and image proxies, same reason again)
         * - r/ (the affiliate pixel and its API proxy: a tracking beacon has no session to
         *   refresh, and it fires on every page)
         * - api/host-metrics (the Incus hosts push their samples with a bearer token, once a minute
         *   each: there is no session to refresh)
         * - api/public/ (what the landing page asks of the app from another origin, without a cookie:
         *   there is no session to refresh)
         * - p/ (published file links: opened by whoever the link was shared with, who has no session
         *   to refresh, and would otherwise each get an anonymous user and a workspace)
         * - published-auth (the round trip a member makes to open a page of their workspace on its
         *   published host: a visitor without a session is sent to sign in, never handed one)
         * - desktop-view (the screen of a coworker in the iOS app's web view: the ticket in its
         *   fragment is the only key, there is no session to refresh nor one to provision)
         * - api/desktop/config (asked by the desktop app before it shows the server, staging
         *   included: it carries no session and must answer before anyone signs in)
         * Feel free to modify this pattern to include more paths.
