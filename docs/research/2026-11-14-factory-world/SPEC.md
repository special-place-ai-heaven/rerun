# The factory world: design spec
as_of 2026-11-14. Status: APPROVED LOOK (owner: "Looks nice" on the production line), build not cut yet.
Supersedes `docs/research/2026-11-14-factory-view/DESIGN.md` except its section 5 (what the app could read).
Prototype: `apps/ui/components/factory/` on sample data; the belt and trace lines in `packages/ui/src/iso-grid`.

The factory is a production line in Rerun's own isometric world, dark by default. Everything on it is a
finite, known thing: a feature is cut into a known number of tasks, each task passes known stages, so every
level on the floor is exact and every motion says something true. Nothing moves for decoration.

## 1. Objects

| Object | What it is | How it looks |
|---|---|---|
| **Coworker** | a Rerun coworker (`code`, LINUS, the loader...) | Rerun's 2x2 buddy with its face: bob, blink, squash |
| **Copy** | one more run of the same coworker at once | the same buddy, see-through, joined to its coworker by a thin trace |
| **Belt** | a path work takes between coworkers | link variant `belt`: a dark band on the floor, slats running, a neon edge in the status colour of what is on it, a slow trace along its middle |
| **Trace** | a light connection (main to copy, studio) | link variant `trace`: a thin see-through line, a neon head travelling end to end, the line behind it lit and fading |
| **Task sphere** | one job (an issue cut for the factory) | a glass sphere riding the belts, filling like a liquid in its status colour; `#issue` and its percentage under it |
| **Scanner gate** | a review | an X-ray gate standing on the belt: the sphere waits inside while a line of light sweeps it; green and on, or red, a shake, and turned aside |
| **Reject bin** | where defects end | an open bin of dark red glass beside the scanners, the rejected spheres heaped in it, its count on the rim |
| **Feature sphere** | a feature (the parent issue a task was cut from) | a large glass sphere in Stock, one mark per task; merged tasks fill it gold, rejected ones settle red at the bottom; empty space is the exact work left; it glows when full |
| **Loader** | the dispatcher | a buddy at the head of the line; queued spheres wait on its belt; it carries the merged count |

## 2. What fills, and from what

- **A task sphere** fills by stage: build up to 40%, review to 70%, checks to 95%, merged full. Inside a
  stage it creeps by the run's steps (`fires.steps`) against the usual length of that stage, never past the
  stage's cap. A fix round takes it back to its builder and it creeps 50 to 60%.
- **A feature sphere's** level is ended tasks over all tasks of the feature (merged gold, rejected red).
  The count of tasks comes from the cut, so it needs the parent link (section 6).
- **A belt's edge** is the colour of what rides on it; a quiet belt keeps the board's blue-white.

Colours: queued `#8ea2ff`, building `#f5a524`, review `#2dd4a3`, fixing `#fb923c`, checks `#6ea8ff`,
merged `#ffe08a`, rejected and held `#ef4444` / `#f87171`.

## 3. Every state and its tell

Every state has a tell by shape and motion as well as colour. "Ledger" is `tools/factory/store.py`
`JOB_STATES`, `holds.py`, `fires`.

| State | Ledger | Tell |
|---|---|---|
| waiting on a task | `waiting` | sphere parked at the loader, empty, dimmed, with a thin thread of light to the sphere it waits on |
| queued | `queued` | sphere in line on the loader's belt; the line closes up as the front one leaves |
| held | `holds.py` | every belt edge turns red and its slats stop; waiting spheres get a red rim; a band shows the time left; the loader shows a padlock |
| building | `building` | sphere settled on the trace between `code` and the copy building it; the copy bobs; amber liquid rises |
| review wait | `review_wait` | sphere queued on the belt in front of the scanners, lid dark |
| reviewing | `reviewing` | inside a scanner gate; the scan line sweeps; green liquid rises |
| fix wait | `fix_wait` | sphere turned aside by a red gate, parked at the scanner with an orange rim |
| fixing | `fixing` | sphere rides the orange belt back to its builder; orange liquid rises |
| checks | `checks` | sphere on the belt back to the loader, blue liquid, the belt edge blue |
| merged | `merged` | sphere full, a gentle shake, rides gold to its feature sphere and pours in |
| rejected | `rejected` | red gate and a shake; the sphere rides to the reject bin and lands on the heap |
| blocked | `blocked` | sphere stops where it is, one sharp shake, a diamond badge and the reason in a bubble; stays until someone acts |
| failed / returned | `failed`, `returned` | a crack across the sphere, one shake, its liquid drains to grey; it goes to the reject bin |
| stalled | `fires` (steps not moving past the clock) | the copy holding it greys and slows; a clock badge on the sphere |
| over budget | `fires` (tokens past the cap) | the sphere glows red at the rim and the copy shudders |
| delegator not answering | heartbeat older than two beats | the floor dims, every slat and trace stops, a clock shows the last beat |

## 4. The motion language

Refined: data flows on the lines; each change of state has its own tell (start = a squash and a light,
finish = a pulse that settles, error = one shake, waiting on a person = a slow breath, hold = dim and lock);
hints sit where the change happened; glows fade, never blink; idle things stay quietly alive.

Cheap, never: everything moving on one beat; loops that mean nothing; colour as the only signal; shaking what
is not wrong; pop-ins with no easing; piled bubbles (two at most); motion that fights a drag or a click;
layout jumping when data refreshes.

Recipes and their sources: MOTION.md (hop, landing, copy ripple, handoff), PACKETS.md (tapered comet that
bends at corners, a queue that backs up with minimum spacing, a squash at corners, the plain route for slot
positions), OPEN-SOURCE.md (one id per job so a task travels; play live data one beat behind, AI Town).
Two traps PACKETS.md measured: a per-route `linear()` easing works only on two-keyframe animations, and
nothing that rides `offset-path` may carry its own scale or translate.

## 5. Around the floor (Rerun parts, repurposed)

- **Foreman chat:** Rerun's coworker chat (`components/chat/AgentChat.tsx`) for Boss, in the shell of the
  foreman column (`components/foreman/ForemanColumn.tsx`), restyled to the factory.
- **Bot panel:** clicking a coworker opens Rerun's side panel (`components/agent/AgentPanel.tsx`): chat, runs,
  schedules, model, effort, skills, tools, services. Missing in Rerun: pausing a coworker by hand.
- **KPIs:** the bar of `factory-metrics.ts` (Rerun's own run measures, the job counts, plan and sign-in),
  and Rerun's monitoring cards and charts (`packages/ui/src/monitoring`) summed across the factory coworkers.
- **Settings:** Rerun's dialog pattern (`PanelEditorShell`, `Segmented`, `Switch`) over the delegator's
  settings: pools, runs per coworker, clocks, holds. Needs a write path to the delegator (later).

## 6. Where the data comes from

**Push.** On every beat the delegator sends one snapshot of the line to the app through the account tool
server it already calls with its own key; the app keeps the latest snapshot per workspace and the factory
page reads it behind sign-in. Chosen because the delegator is deliberately closed (no published ports, no
other networks, no host paths but its read-only tools mount), its ledger is SQLite in WAL mode (not read
cleanly through a read-only mount), and the app has no SQLite reader.

- **One value, replaced each beat,** with the time it was made; "not answering" is a snapshot older than two
  beats.
- **Never stops a beat:** its own try, a short timeout, an unknown-tool answer logged once.
- **Trust:** the schema lives in `packages/contracts` with a size cap; the snapshot is keyed by the calling
  key's workspace, never global; the read is behind sign-in; BRUCE reviews the new write before it merges.
- **Carries:** every job with its state, when it entered it, coworker and copy, run steps and tokens
  (`fires`), PR and fix round; the holds with their end time; the pools and runs per coworker; the beat
  number; the repository; each job's parent feature (nullable until the link below exists).

**Parent link: needs dispatcher work.** The ledger has no task-to-feature link; the cut names its parent in
prose ("Part of #198"). The cut format gets a `**Part of**: #n` line, read like `**Depends on**`.

## 7. Open

- Eyes that look around on a board: Rerun turns them off with many buddies. Proposed: a per-task eye motion
  (scan while reviewing, look down while building). The owner decides.
- Frame cost: slats and trace layers animate dash offset (a repaint per frame); `offset-distance` runs on the
  main thread in Chrome (PACKETS.md). Measure with a full floor before shipping.
