"""Factory dispatcher (rerun#112): carries several labelled issues at once through build -> review -> one fix round ->
checks -> merge on live coworkers. Server port of ~/.claude/scripts/rerun-factory.mjs.
  dispatch.py run | once      (the status command is `timeline.py status`)
One pass is single-threaded and never waits on a coworker: each unfinished job moves at most one step. Every change is
written to the ledger (store.py) at once as a transitions row, and a send is recorded as an intent row before it goes
out, so a restart never sends a step twice."""
